# Development Process Summary: Summary of Development
## Overview
This summary will go over the development of this project which was made throughout the course with the assistance of AI. The project is comprised of a couple systems:
It was designed and created in python using vscode. The project is ran using the terminal in your machine. During the creation of this project, I created a few prototypes that each played a role in the development of the final version.
## Task 1
This is the starting point of this project. It introduced me to generating code using github's Copilot AI. The task was to create a command-line interface that functions as a task manager with only a few basic functions. It serves as a base for the task manager system in the final version and the storing structure (using a JSON file) was taken from this task and implemented into both the final version of the task manager and the PKMS. For this task I mainly used github's copilot in ask mode using the GPT-4o mini agent. I also used ClaudeAI prior to beginning this task to help me create a plan for this task. I took ClaudeAI's plan and put it into a file in vscode. I attached the file as context when talking to Copilot. This was the first time I used multiple AI's for a project like this.
## Task 2
This task was to iterate on the first task. The goal was to learn how to get the AI to improve upon the previous code. This taught me how to structure my prompts when talking to the AI. This is a small, yet vital, step in the development of this project. This task also let me explore the use of different AI's and how they return different results and ideas. I mainly used Copilot in the GPT-4o mini agent. When I started talking to the AI I hit a few roadblocks with implementing the new features. This taught me to prompt the AI with more details in order to avoid issues. In the end some of the added features in this task were ultimately not included in the final version. This is because during the development of the final version, some of the added features seemed redundant when compared to the other features.
## Task 3
This is the most crucial task in the project development. Task 3 was the first time I used pytest and learned how to test code. In the final development stages of the project I had to develop several tests to ensure the code functions as intended. The task itself was to write tests for the different methods, like add, list and search, to see if the code functions as intended. At first, writing the tasks were difficult and a bit hard to understand. This taught me how to write effective tests and the importance of testing code over and over again. I had the AI run the code with the tests and many times, it resulted in errors and issues. This is by far the most challenging portion of the development. Once I was able to execute a test without issue I moved on to the next test. Many of the tests that were located in this task were used in the early stages of development of the final version.
## Task 4
This task involves the use of OpenAI. Task 4 is mostly apart of the AI Agent component of this project. The task was to experiment with OpenAI to summarize the description of the tasks that were created in the task manager. Task 2 was copied over into this task and the code for the task manager was a main part in this task. I asked Claude AI some questions regarding the implementation of OpenAI into the project. This helped me understand the inner workings of doing this that I didn't quite get in class. I was able to successfully integrate OpenAI into the the task manager and successfully made a request to OpenAI using my API key. The code and functionality from here is almost identical in the final version with some differences. The integration was assisted by github's Copilot.
## Task 5
This task was not directly used in the final version but was important in another way. Task 5 was made using spec-kit. The AI created a couple documents that would be accessed and updated by the AI as the development went on. These documents were incredibly useful in the development of the task manager. It helped the AI create a larger task by breaking it down in to smaller ones. On top of that, one of the files involved the specs of the overall project with helped with keeping the AI on track and progressing through the different bullet points. Like I mentioned earlier, I did not use spec-kit directly in the development of the final version, but I did use similar methods I learned from spec-kit such as the specs document and breaking up the different parts of the final version.
## Final Version
The development of the final version was done using the previous tasks (1-5) as a framework for beginning it. The AI agents used were github's Copilot in GPT-4o mini and Claude AI. I used task 1 and 2 to help me formulate an initial prompt to Claude. I included what the project was, needed to have, and how it would function to Claude to develop a plan. Once I finalized the plan, I put it into a document and added it, along with tasks 1 and 2, as context in Copilot to create the initial design of the project. I asked the AI to individually create the task manager, PKMS, terminal based chat interface, and AI Agent separately. Once each part was completed, I used the pytest knowledge I gained from task3, as well as some tests, to write tests to make sure each part functioned properly. I hit a few roadblocks with this but eventually I ended up with something that works. Throughout the process I had the AI make some suggestions on things to add and to check if there would be any conflict when implementing anything new. In these suggestions, I ended up removing the search function from the task manager and PKMS since both me and the AI agreed that with the list function it becomes redundant. In place of it, I integrated due dates and priority into the task manager that are displayed when listing out the tasks. I also did this with the PKMS but only implemented priority. The terminal-based chat interface was one of the biggest issue I e across. I had many issues with getting the task manager, PKMS, and AI agent to run in the interface. Often times when the AI changes something in the code, it would break the chat interface and I would need to go back and identify the issue then explain it to the AI. After many tests and repeated failures I was able successfully use the chat interface to run the task manager, PKMS, and AI agent. As explained earlier I pretty much used the same thing in task 4 for this part. The command sends a request to the OPENAI API and has it summarize the contents of the task/note description into one sentence. Once I completed that I ran final tests and tested the chat interface in my terminal to ensure it all functions correctly.
## Conclusion
This project and class taught me how to use AI to create and develop projects. I learned how to prompt AI, test for bugs, and connect systems together. My learning is reflected in my development of this project and is culminated in the final version of my software.
